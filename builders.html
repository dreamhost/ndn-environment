    <dt id="Perl">Perl</dt>
    <dd>
        This will download, configure, and build the perl version specified in
        the config file or command line.
    </dd>

    <dt id="Cpanm">Cpanm</dt>
    <dd>
        This will install cpanm into the custom built perl.
    </dd>

    <dt id="EnvPAN">EnvPAN</dt>
    <dd>
        This will bootstrap OrePAN2 and inject the modules listed in your
        config file from cpan.

        <p>

        Note: It is best to add the envpan directory this builds to your
        project git repo, that way building from fresh checkouts of your
        environment will build with the same module versions.
    </dd>

    <dt id="Modules">Modules</dt>
    <dd>
        Build all the modules listed in your config file, as well as their
        dependencies. Will ONLY use modules that have been added to envpan. If
        envpan is missing a dependency then this build will fail. There is an
        --auto_deps flag that will make envpan inject deps from cpan as it
        finds them, which is useful for initial bootstrapping.
    </dd>

    <dt id="Static">Static</dt>
    <dd>
        Will copy the static/* files to build/* so that they will be included
        in any package that is built.
    </dd>

    <dt id="ModPerl">ModPerl</dt>
    <dd>
        Will build mod_perl against the system apache and your custom perl.
    </dd>

    <dt id="ImageMagick">ImageMagick</dt>
    <dd>
        Builds ImageMagick against the custom perl.
    </dd>

    <dt id="Package">Package</dt>
    <dd>
        Created a package for your environment.
    </dd>

    <dt id="CUSTOM">CUSTOM</dt>
    <dd>
        Builders are plugins, it is easy to add custom ones.
