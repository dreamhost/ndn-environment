        <h2>Concept</h2>

        Ndn-Enironment is a build system that takes a specification and builds
        a perl environment from it. It uses a git-like command line interface
        to initialize an environment project, and built it. An environment
        project can be used to produce identical environments across multiple
        platforms.

        <p>

        A built environment will ultimately be packaged as a deb (or
        potentially other systems). It will contain whatever components you
        specify in your configuration. Some options include:

        <ul>
            <li>Custom-built perl</li>
            <li>mod_perl built against the custom perl and system apache</li>
            <li>perl modules you request</li>
            <li>ImageMagick + perl libraries</li>
            <li>Static Files</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

        <h2>Module Management</h2>

        Ndn-Environment uses <a
        href="https://metacpan.org/release/OrePAN2">OrePAN2</a> which is a
        DarkPAN management system. Essentially OrePAN2 creates a local cpan
        mirror that only contains modules we add. This allows us to rebuild the
        environment on any machine at any time without worrying about pulling
        down different module versions.

        <p>

        Because of OrePAN you can mirror dists from CPAN, a local file, a url,
        or even a github project. cpanm is able to use the OrePAN mirror which
        makes installing modules and deps from your mirror quite simple. Under
        the hood Ndn-Environment will use cpanm.

        <h2>Bootstrapping</h2>

        Ndn-Environment does its best to avoid both dependence, and
        interference with the system perl. A system perl is needed to run
        Ndn-Environment, but it has very few dependencies. Most tools that
        ndn-environment needs will be downloaded and installed into the project
        directory when needed.

        <p>

        Bootstrapping will prepare the following:

        <ul>
            <li>DarkPAN (OrePAN2)</li>
            <li>cpanm</li>
            <li>Dependencies of the toolchain</li>
        </ul>
